# *DOCUMENTATION*
Full install guides and all needed informations can be found at the documentation at this folder:
```bash
./GUIDES/DOCUMENTATION/index.html
```

<br />
<br />
Please notice that the documentation was build long time ago and is outdated and is not designed properly. It was created when I had no experience at web design. Even when the core informations are still correct some informations might be not be up 2 date anymore.

However I used the documentation back in the days on upwork but since I not work the anymore I never updated the documentation properly to puppeteer and MongoDB. The documentation will maybe re-designed in the future but I dont think so unless there will be more customers for my bots.. It would be just a time waste for my side to create a new documentation at this point. I hope you understand.

However if you know how Node.js, Puppeteer & MongoDB works there is literally no need to read the documentation.
